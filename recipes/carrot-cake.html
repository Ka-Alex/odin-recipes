    <p>This carrot cake recipe with a homemade cream cheese frosting is my favorite, and I have tried many carrot cakes!
        It's moist, easy to make with grated carrots, and so delicious!

        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine grated carrots and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit for 1 hour, then stir in raisins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 10-inch round cake pans. Beat eggs
            in a large bowl until light.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually beat in white sugar, oil, and vanilla. Stir in pineapple.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl, then stir into egg mixture until
            absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in carrot mixture and walnuts. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool for 10 minutes before removing cake layers from the pans; let cool completely.
