    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an amazing recipe for no-bake cheesecake with whipping cream and cream cheese that I just threw together
        one day — no oven, no eggs. Everyone loves it so much, that it doesn't last long! Top with your favorite canned
        or fresh fruit.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling or fresh berries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir together graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add melted butter and mix
            well. Press into the bottom of an 8- or 10-inch springform pan. Chill until firm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat together cream cheese and lemon juice in a medium bowl until soft. Add whipping cream and beat with an
            electric mixer until the batter becomes thick. Add sugar and continue to beat until stiff.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour into chilled crust, and top with pie filling or fresh fruit. Chill for several hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just before serving, remove the sides of the springform pan.
        </li>
    </ol>
