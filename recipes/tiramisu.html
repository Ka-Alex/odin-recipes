    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic tiramisu recipe is the best! A rich mascarpone cheese mixture is layered with espresso-soaked
        ladyfingers for a decadent dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 (8.8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons amaretto liqueur, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups brewed espresso, cooled</li>
        <li>1 ½ (12 ounce) packages ladyfingers (about 30)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add mascarpone
            cheese and 2 tablespoons amaretto. Beat well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with clean beaters until stiff peaks form. Fold beaten
            egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour espresso and remaining 2 tablespoons amaretto into a shallow dish. Stir well. Working one at a time,
            quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture and line the bottom of an 8-inch glass dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the bottom of the dish is covered in an even layer of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, top with 1/2 the
            mascarpone mixture. Repeat with another ladyfinger layer, followed by the remaining mascarpone mixture.
            Chill in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dust with cocoa powder before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
