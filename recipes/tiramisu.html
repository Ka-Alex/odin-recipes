    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic tiramisu recipe is the best! A rich mascarpone cheese mixture is layered with espresso-soaked
        ladyfingers for a decadent dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>6 large eggs, separated, divided</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>3 tablespoons sugar</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>2 (8.8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>4 tablespoons amaretto liqueur, divided</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>1 ½ cups brewed espresso, cooled</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>1 ½ (12 ounce) packages ladyfingers (about 30)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>1 tablespoon cocoa powder, or as needed</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Combine egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add
                mascarpone cheese and 2 tablespoons amaretto. Beat well.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with clean beaters until stiff peaks form. Fold beaten
                egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Pour espresso and remaining 2 tablespoons amaretto into a shallow dish. Stir well. Working one at a time,
                quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture and line the bottom of an 8-inch glass dish.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Once the bottom of the dish is covered in an even layer of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, top with 1/2 the
                mascarpone mixture. Repeat with another ladyfinger layer, followed by the remaining mascarpone mixture.
                Chill in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Dust with cocoa powder before serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
